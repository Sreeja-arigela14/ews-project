            <img src="work bench.jpeg" alt="Work Bench">
            <p>A fitting process can be done at various places, but most of the important operations of fitting are generally carried out on a table called work bench.
            The work bench is a strong, heavy and rigid table made up of hard wood. The size of the work bench required is about 150 to 180 cm length, nearly 90 cm width and approximately 76 to 84 cm height.</p>

            <img src="bench .jpeg" alt="Bench Vice">
            <p>It is firmly fixed to the bench with the help of nuts and bolts. It consists of a cast iron body and cast iron jaws. Two jaw plates are fitted on both the jaws. The holding surface of the jaw plates is knurled in order to increase the gripping. Jaw plates are made up of carbon steel and are wear-resistant. One jaw is fixed to the body and the second slides on a square threaded screw with the help of a handle. The jaws are opened up to the required length; the job is placed in the two jaws and is fully tightened with the help of a handle. The handle is used to move the movable jaw.</p>
