            <h4>A. Scriber and Surface Gauge</h4>
            <img src="scriber.jpeg" alt="Scriber and Surface Gauge">
            <p>It consists of a cast iron base on the center of which a steel rod is fixed vertically. The scriber is made up of high carbon steel and is hardened from the front edge. It is used for locating the centers of round bars or for marking lines.</p>

            <h4>B. Punches</h4>
            <p>Punches are used for marking purposes. Dot punches are used for marking dotted lines and center punches are used to mark the center of holes before drilling. Punches are made up of high carbon steel or high-speed steels. One end is sharpened. Hammering is done on the second end while working. In dot punch, the angle of the punching end is 60 degrees while in center punch, the angle of the punching end is 90 degrees.</p>

            <img src="try square.jpeg" alt="Try Square">
            <p>It is used for checking the squareness of two surfaces. It consists of a blade made up of steel, which is attached to a base at 90 degrees. The base is made up of cast iron or steel. It is also used to mark right angles and measure the straightness of surfaces. Never use a try square as a hammer.</p>

            <h4>D. Vernier Height Gauge</h4>
            <img src="vernier.jpeg" alt="Vernier Height Gauge">
            <p>A Vernier height gauge consists of a heavy base, a graduated beam, a sliding head with Vernier sliding jaws holding the scriber, and a fine adjustment clamp. It is similar to large Vernier calipers in construction, except that it consists of a heavy base which allows the gauge to stand upright. Instead of a fixed jaw in a Vernier, the movable jaw of the Vernier height gauge consists of a projection or extension which is leveled to a sharp edge for scribing lines at any required height.</p>
